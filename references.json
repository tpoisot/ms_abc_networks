Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,2]]},"title-short":"Predicting species distribution","container-title-short":"Ecol.

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1633576100","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1633576100","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bascompte","given":"J."},{"family":"Jordano","given":"P."},{"family":"Melian","given":"C.

In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection.

Important topological properties of networks such as nestedness and modularity are thought to be affected by coevolution. However, there has been no test whether coevolution does, in fact, lead to predictable network structure. Here, we investigate the structure of simulated bipartite networks generated under different modes of coevolution. We ask whether evolutionary processes influence network structure and, furthermore, whether any emergent trends are influenced by the strength or “intimacy” of the species interactions. We find that coevolution leaves a weak and variable signal on network topology, particularly nestedness and modularity, which was not strongly affected by the intimacy of interactions. Our findings indicate that network metrics, on their own, should not be used to make inferences about processes underlying the evolutionary history of communities. Instead, a more holistic approach that combines network approaches with traditional phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions is needed.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1798/abstract","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.1798","ISSN":"2150-8925","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Ponisio","given":"Lauren C."},{"family":"M'Gonigle","given":"Leithen K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,9]]},"container-title-short":"Ecosphere"},

Thus, network structures which are over-represented in natural systems are often hypothesised to be either a cause or consequence of ecological stability. Rarely considered, however, is that these network structures can also be by-products of the processes that determine how new species attempt to join the community. Using a simulation approach in tandem with key results from random matrix theory, we illustrate how historical assembly mechanisms alter the structure of ecological networks. We demonstrate that different community assembly scenarios can lead to the emergence of structures that are often interpreted as evidence of ‘selection for stability’. However, by controlling for the underlying selection pressures, we show that these assembly artefacts—or spandrels—are completely unrelated to stability or selection, and are instead by-products of how new species are introduced into the system. We propose that these network-assembly spandrels are critically overlooked aspects of network theory and stability analysis, and we illustrate how a failure to adequately account for historical assembly can lead to incorrect inference about the causes and consequences of ecological stability.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12912/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12912","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Maynard","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Serván","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Allesina","given":"Stefano"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,7]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol Lett"},

Non-Darwinian models such as macromutations have been proposed as a means of bridging seemingly large gaps in knowledge, or as a means to explain the origin of exquisitely adapted body plans. However, such gaps can be spanned by new fossil finds, and complex, integrated organisms can be shown to have evolved piecemeal. For example, the fossil record between dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx has now filled up with astonishing fossil intermediates that show how the unique plexus of avian adaptations emerged step by step over 60 Myr. New numerical approaches to morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods allow palaeontologists and biologists to work together on deep-time questions of evolution, to explore how diversity, morphology and function have changed through time. Patterns are more complex than sometimes expected, with frequent decoupling of species diversity and morphological diversity, pointing to the need for some new generalizations about the processes that lie behind such patterns.","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590474/","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2015.0569","ISSN":"0962-8452","author":[{"family":"Benton","given":"Michael J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,9]]},"PMID":"26063844","PMCID":"PMC4590474","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci"},

Indirect effects, as when antagonistic or mutualistic interactions restrict geographic range and thereby elevate extinction risk, are probably widespread and may flow in both directions, as when species- or organismic-level factors increase extinction risk or speciation probabilities. Apparent contradictions across scales and levels have been neglected, including (1) the individualistic geographic shifts of species on centennial and millennial timescales versus evidence for fine-tuned coevolutionary relationships; (2) the extensive and dynamic networks of interactions faced by most species versus the evolution of costly enemy-specific defenses and finely attuned mutualisms; and (3) the macroevolutionary lags often seen between the origin and the diversification of a clade or an evolutionary novelty versus the rapid microevolution of advantageous phenotypes and the invasibility of most communities. Resolution of these and other cross-level tensions presumably hinges on how organismic interactions impinge on genetic population structures, geographic ranges, and the persistence of incipient species, but generalizations are not yet possible. Paleontological and neontological data are both incomplete and so the most powerful response to these problems will require novel integrative approaches. Promising research areas include more realistic approaches to modeling and empirical analysis of large-scale diversity dynamics of ostensibly competing clades; spatial and phylogenetic dissections of clades involved in escalatory dynamics (where prey respond evolutionarily to a broad and shifting array of enemies); analyses of the short- versus long-term consequences of mutualistic symbioses; and fuller use of abundant natural experiments on the evolutionary impacts of ecosystem engineers.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00317.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00317.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Jablonski","given":"David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,9]]},"title-short":"Biotic Interactions and Macroevolution"},

Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12104/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12104","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Münkemüller","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Mouillot","given":"David"},{"family":"Mouquet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Schiffers","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,9]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol Lett"},

That said, extant ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters and local effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host–parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.03788","DOI":"10.1111/oik.03788","ISSN":"1600-0706","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,3]]}}
