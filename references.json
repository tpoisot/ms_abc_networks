Julia is  designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature\"  by practitioners of numerical computing: \\beginlist \\item  High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \\item  One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \\item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \\endlist We introduce the  Julia programming language and its design---a  dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch,  a  technique from computer science, picks  the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that  one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.","URL":"http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/141000671","DOI":"10.1137/141000671","ISSN":"0036-1445","author":[{"family":"Bezanson","given":"J."},{"family":"Edelman","given":"A."},{"family":"Karpinski","given":"S."},{"family":"Shah","given":"V."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,21]]},"title-short":"Julia","container-title-short":"SIAM Rev."},

  {"id":"SunBus13","type":"article-journal","title":"Approximate Bayesian Computation","container-title":"PLoS Computational Biology","volume":"9","issue":"1","source":"PubMed Central","abstract":"Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547661/","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002803","ISSN":"1553-734X","author":[{"family":"Sunnåker","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Busetto","given":"Alberto Giovanni"},{"family":"Numminen","given":"Elina"},{"family":"Corander","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Foll","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Dessimoz","given":"Christophe"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,5]]},"PMID":"23341757","PMCID":"PMC3547661","container-title-short":"PLoS Comput Biol"},

Non-Darwinian models such as macromutations have been proposed as a means of bridging seemingly large gaps in knowledge, or as a means to explain the origin of exquisitely adapted body plans. However, such gaps can be spanned by new fossil finds, and complex, integrated organisms can be shown to have evolved piecemeal. For example, the fossil record between dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx has now filled up with astonishing fossil intermediates that show how the unique plexus of avian adaptations emerged step by step over 60 Myr. New numerical approaches to morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods allow palaeontologists and biologists to work together on deep-time questions of evolution, to explore how diversity, morphology and function have changed through time. Patterns are more complex than sometimes expected, with frequent decoupling of species diversity and morphological diversity, pointing to the need for some new generalizations about the processes that lie behind such patterns.","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590474/","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2015.0569","ISSN":"0962-8452","author":[{"family":"Benton","given":"Michael J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,9]]},"PMID":"26063844","PMCID":"PMC4590474","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci"}
